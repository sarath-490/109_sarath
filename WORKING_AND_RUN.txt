SMS Spam Filter – Working & Run Instructions

This project implements an SMS Spam Detection system for a telecom messaging gateway. It classifies incoming SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Legitimate) using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. The solution follows a hybrid approach combining TF-IDF based text vectorization, a Naive Bayes classifier, and simple regex-based rules for URLs and spam keywords.

Working of the System

The dataset (SMS Spam Collection) is loaded and cleaned.

SMS labels are encoded (spam = 1, ham = 0).

Each message is analyzed using regex rules to detect URLs, currency symbols, and urgency keywords such as free, win, claim, etc.

Messages are converted into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization.

A Multinomial Naive Bayes model is trained on 80% of the data.

The remaining 20% is used for evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Predictions are exported to a CSV file.

The system supports real-time testing where users can input any SMS message and get Spam/Ham classification.

An optional AI explanation module demonstrates how an LLM could explain why a message is classified as spam.
